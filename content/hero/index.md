I'm an Pakistan based Unity3D / Unreal Engine developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

I enjoy working on a variety of games and have worked on mobile, VR and AR projects. I am an avid gamer who can critically analyze game mechanics and provide feedback on the creation of video games.
