Hello! I have been a student of Computer Science in my college and got introduced to programming in my intermediate year at [Rawalpindi College Of Commerece](https://rcc.edu.pk/). Since then, I developed an intrest in programming, and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from [Iqra University](https://iqra.edu.pk/) (2011-2016).

Today, I'm currently working as a Technical Team Lead responsible for development of android games, from conception of an idea to the publishing process.

I have also been part of the team which got featured as one of the [Fast Companyâ€™s 10 Most Innovative AR and VR Companies](https://www.fastcompany.com/90457929/virtual-augmented-reality-most-innovative-companies-2020) in 2020.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with!
